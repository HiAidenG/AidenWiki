Gene: *DnaC*

# Function 
'Loading protein' for [[Helicase]]. Positions DnaB on double stranded DNA, also prevents it from initiating. Once it has been loaded, however, DnaC releases and helicase can begin unwinding the DNA. 

Accomplishes this through changing the conformation of the helicase. Helicase hydrolyzes ATP, ejects DnaC and begins unwinding the sequence.

However, experiments have shown that helicase has innate activity without DnaC.
