Pol III is a holoenzyme, composed of mulitple active protein subunits.

# Function
Synthesizes **new DNA** in the 5' to 3' direction, template is 3' to 5'

On the leading strand--the one in the 5' to 3' direction, Pol III can synthesize new DNA continuously. On the lagging strand, synthesis is discontinuous, so Pol III falls off the DNA and must rebind many times. 

DNA Polymerases, in general, have elongation activity, but not initiation. This means they require a template. 

Therefore, RNA primers must be synthesized to allow Pol III to begin replication. In the case of the leading strand, only one must be made. But for the lagging strand, each [[Okazaki-Fragment]] must have a primer.

Evidence that there are two lagging strand polymerases.
	**How would you test that?**
	- Cryo EM, probably. Freeze the polymerases during replication.

Pol III has innate proofreading capability in order to remove improperly paired bases, its exonuclease activity is 3' to 5', so it can remove bases as they are being synthesized. (akin to a backspace button)

# Testing Error Rate


# Measuring Processivity


# Why Only 5' to 3'?
It has been theorized that proofreading activity would not be energetically favorable if new DNA is synthesied in the 3' to 5' direction.
