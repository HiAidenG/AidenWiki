# Function
Methylates the new strand of DNA as it is being replicated at specific consensus sequences. Recorgnizes GATC palindromes in the [OriC](OriC.md) and immediately methylates the adenine on both new strands. These GATC sequences overlap the DNA boxes recognized by [DnaA](DnaA.md)

The now hemi-methylated DNA can be recognized by [SeqA](SeqA.md)
