# Function
Binds to hemi-methylated DNA at GATC sites, which overlap with the DNA boxes in the [OriC](OriC.md). This prevents the binding of [DnaA](DnaA.md). Therefore, replication cannot be initiated a second time from the same origin. This prevents excessive copying of the DNA during S phase. 

However, mutants lacking DAM and SeqA are still viable, so initiation of replication is controlled by other factos as well.
